            Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood. If you or someone you know has a mental illness, is struggling emotionally, or has concerns about their mental health, there are ways to get help.
